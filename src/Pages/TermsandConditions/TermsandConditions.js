        Any failure by SIGNET to deliver or install products or to otherwise perform caused by reason of any of the following
        events shall not constitute an event of default or breach of any Terms and Conditions of this Agreement or any other
        contractual document between the parties: strikes, picket lines, boycott efforts, fires, floods, freeze, accidents, war
        (whether or not declared), revolution, riots, insurrections, acts of God, acts of government (including without limitation
        any agency or department of the United States of America or any other country, any state or local government), acts of the
        public enemy, scarcity or rationing of gasoline or other fuel or vital products, inability to obtain materials or labor,
        and/or any other causes which are not reasonably foreseeable at the time of execution of this Agreement, or which are
        reasonably beyond the control of SIGNET.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent allowed by applicable law, Client will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SIGNET from and against all
        direct, indirect and/or any third-party claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including attorney&#39;s fees and all
        settlement costs) arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or to Client&#39;s or Client&#39;s agents, contractors
        and/or employees&#39; acts or omissions, including any unsafe worksite, building or property condition, regardless of
        whether or not the claims, liabilities, damages or costs were caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder. The parties
        agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries express or implied to this or any other contract between Client and
        SIGNET. To the extent allowed by applicable law, Client will also indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SIGNET from any
        government or third-party actions, fines and/or penalties arising from Client&#39;s failure to follow or abide by any
        applicable laws, including without limitation, public bidding laws and prevailing wage laws or other employment laws.
        Client&#39;s indemnification and defense obligations shall all survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement,
        irrespective of the cause, and shall extend to claims arising after all services have been fully performed. This
        indemnification obligation shall not be limited by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation, or
        benefits payable by or for Subcontractor under worker&#39;s compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee
        benefit acts.

        SIGNET will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including
        settlement costs) arising out of SIGNET&#39;s gross negligence or willful misconduct, which has been finally adjudicated,
        including but not limited to liabilities, damages and costs arising out of: (1) defective or faulty installation; and (ii)
        any violations of applicable laws or code requirements related to the installation. For purposes of clarity, SIGNET will
        not have any obligations or liability under this Agreement arising from any hazardous, unsafe and/or unknown conditions at
        Client&#39;s premises. Client certification of Asbestos presence: Unless noted above, the Client hereby certifies that
        Asbestos and/or Asbestos-bearing materials are not present in the areas in which SIGNET&#39;s work will be performed. Work
        in Asbestos hazard areas and/or Asbestos removal is not included in this Agreement and, if required, will be performed at
        an additional cost by an authorized, certified contractor. SIGNET shall take reasonable efforts to notify Client of any
        resulting delay, and Client shall grant SIGNET any reasonable time extensions and/or cost increases arising out the
        hazardous condition. SIGNET shall have full control and authority over the defense and resolution of any indemnified
        claims, except that (a) any settlement requiring the Client to admit liability or to pay any money will require
        Client&#39;s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) Client may join in
        the defense with its own counsel at its own expense.

        This proposal and any drawings, designs, specifications or other information provided by SIGNET in connection with this
        proposal shall all be considered Confidential Information and the proprietary business information of SIGNET (hereinafter,
        Confidential Information). The recipient of any Confidential Information shall not disclose any Confidential Information,
        except to employees, and/or agents who need to know it and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. The
        recipient shall also ensure that those employees and/or agents shall use the Confidential Information only to exercise
        rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement and shall keep the Confidential Information confidential and destroy
        it once it is no longer needed. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information when required by law after giving
        SIGNET reasonable notice and an opportunity to seek confidential treatment, a protective order or similar remedies or
        relief prior to disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        All claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach thereof, shall
        be adjudicated via litigation in either the Superior or District Courts located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, unless
        SIGNET in its sole discretion elects to have such claims adjudicated by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be exclusively
        held in Boston, Massachusetts and shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American
        Arbitration Association then in effect. This Subcontract shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
        Massachusetts, without regard to its conflict of laws rules or principles. In its discretion, SIGNET may also join or
        consolidate any claims between it and Client with litigation or arbitration proceedings between SIGNET any other party,
        wherever such proceedings are located, provided the proceedings involve, in any way, this Agreement and/or SIGNET&#39;s
        work for Client. Client waives any objection to the jurisdiction, forum, choice of law, venue and dispute resolution
        procedures which govern such proceedings and agrees to be bound by the results.

      <br />
      <p>
        In the event any claim(s) is/are brought against SIGNET in connection with this Agreement and/or SIGNET&#39;s work,
        SIGNET&#39;s liability shall not exceed the amount Client has actually paid SIGNET at the time either litigation or
        arbitration proceedings are initiated, irrespective of whether the claim(s) asserted is/are for breach of contract, tort,
        equitable relief, or otherwise. Client waives any claims for punitive, incidental and/or consequential damages, including
        delay damages of any kind, loss of use, and/or damages under chapter 93A.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        SIGNET shall not be responsible for hidden conditions, defects in the work of others not reasonably observable, or
        conditions it was not provided the opportunity to view prior to execution of the Agreement. SIGNET has no design duties,
        and shall not be responsible for errors, omissions or deficiencies in the design of the Work. SIGNET shall have no
        responsibility for or liability arising out of any design, functionality, methodology and/or other decisions made by
        Client, Client&#39;s designer(s) or any third party not in Client&#39;s control. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
        inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns including any successor or assign of SIGNET
        upon the sale of all or substantially all of its stock or assets.
